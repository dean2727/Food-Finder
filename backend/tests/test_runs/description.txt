This folder will contain examples of conversations for a given team supervisor system prompt.
Recall that the supervisor is responsible for performing Google Maps searches and filtering/
sorting the request/results based on user preferences. Then, (in future state), interacting 
with the user (human feedback node) and subordinates (likely just a review analyzer) to 
get to a state of found_place = true.

Each file (tx.json, where x is the system prompt version) will contain conversations in the format:
{
    [
        "supervisor_system_prompt": "<system prompt for version x>",
        "run_outputs": [
            {
                "Human message": "<human message on UI>",
                "AI message": "<AI message on UI>",
                "Human message": "<human message on UI>",
                "AI message": "<AI message on UI>",
                ...<remaining UI messages>...
            }
        ],
        ...<remaining conversations>...
    ]
}

Note: The LLM will remain constant, the LLM temperature will be 0 throughout all test runs,
the system prompts of the other agents will remain fixed, and the same conversations will be
run for each prompt, for a fair comparison of system prompts.
