The Szechuan chilli chicken was very impressive, I’ve had many variations of this dish with chicken and this one with vegan chicken is just as good as the best meat ones I’ve had. The wok fried beans were stir fried perfectly and had a nice char and crunch to it.\n\nThe dumplings were incredible, we had the English spinach, mushroom and sweet corn, and pandan choysum dumplings. All were gluten free as well and exquisitely made, very soft skin that’s packed with delicious filling. They also had homemade chilli oil on each table and they were perfect to go with the dumplings.\n\nFor dessert I had the mango pancakes and they were awesome, fresh mango wrapped with delicious coconut cream and freshly made crepe. One of my favourite desserts.\n\nAll the food we had were gluten free except the chilli chicken and mango pancakes. My partner is coeliac and enjoyed the gluten free options with no issues.

Opting for the banquet menu left us pleasantly full without the usual heaviness of meat. We appreciated the absence of vegetarian meat substitutes, allowing the natural flavors to shine. The interesting beer selection added to the experience, making it a must-try for both vegetarians and meat lovers alike. Overall, Yulli’s exceeded our expectations and comes highly recommended.",

Some options are also gluten-free.\n\nThe star of the show is undoubtedly the Pho, available in various varieties, each one a delight. You won't be disappointed.

From the moment you walk in, you're made to feel like family, and this warmth carries through to every aspect of your dining experience. The owner's kindness knows no bounds, and ensure you leave with a smile on your face.\n\nDespite the high quality of the food and service, the prices at Hạnh Phúc Vegan are surprisingly affordable, making it accessible to all.\nIn fact, the owner's generosity often extends to throwing in a little something extra with your meal, ensuring that you feel valued as a customer.\n\nOne aspect worth noting, go to the bathroom. It may seem like an odd inclusion in a review but trust me when I say it's a “Cu Chi” tunnel experience.\n\nYou will leave with a full stomach, a happy heart, and a newfound appreciation for the joys of plant-based dining.",

However, saying the entire experience was disappointing is putting it mildly. After 40 minutes of waiting for our food, only one person from our group got their order. We sat there looking at each other waiting for the other meals while his food got cold. It is not uncommon for these sort of things to happen on a busy day but it wasn’t a busy night, atleast from what we could see. The food was hardly average and the service was extremely slow. Super disappointed. The new interior looks good, however, wish they’d focus on their food and their service.",

From the moment we stepped in, our jackets were graciously taken and we were promptly seated at the cozy bar.\n\nThen taken to our table by the lovely hostess.\n\nHaving Joe as our waiter was truly exceptional. He enthusiastically guided us through his favourite items on the menu and his pleasant demeanour showcased his English charm.\n\nThe food arrived right on schedule and each dish was absolutely delightful.\n\nWhat a fantastic experience at Spice Temple! This was my second visit and I'm already eagerly looking forward to my third.",

            "text": "We stopped here for a birthday dinner and were promptly greeted and made comfortable.\n\nThe ambiance is proper, and certainly feels like a high end restaurant. The service is great too — and all the servers who attended to us were warm, explained each course clearly and checked in on us through the course of our meal. They even got us a complimentary slice of cake (which was pretty good) for the birthday girl. That was a lovely gesture!\n\nHowever the food here is definitely raw vegan food — and lacks flavor for most of em (except the mushroom skewer which is a $9 pp extra). The saving grace was the complimentary bread & miso butter along with the hazelnut ice cream. Rest of the menu was pretty passable and nothing extraordinary given the high price. The cocktails (extra) were pretty decent but nothing to write home about.\n\nAlso, at $115 per person; I don’t expect to see extras on the tasting menu. Either give it all or don’t.\n\nThere’s a lot you can do with vegan food — bringing in the flavors of veggies by cooking them in various ways, but unfortunately Yellow fails to hit the mark with its flavors. Definitely passable given the high price point.",
