            "text": "While exploring Austin, my wife and I both wanted some dumplings. So we made a reservation and headed to Lin Asian Bar and Dim Sum. Lin's is a health-conscious eatery serving Chinese fare and Dim Sum with locally-sourced ingredients.\n\nWe started with Lin's Soup Dumplings. The dumplings were sticky and chewy while the filling was tender and flavorful. The broth on the inside had a hint of sweet and a saltiness that pairs well with the chewy dumpling.\n\nWe also tried the Akaushi Beef Potstickers. Interestingly, the potsticker has a crispy wafer with it, however, it did not offer any flavor. The filling was tender and juicy but did not offer a lot of flavor. The dipping sauce was sweet with a hint of sour and adds needed flavor to the dish.\n\nI ordered the Orange Peel Akaushi Beef with steamed rice. This entree has sauteed Akaushi beef in an orange sauce with orange peel and chili. The rice was cooked perfectly. The beef had a little crust on it and was very tender and slightly chewy, although it was  stringy in a few bites. The sauce was thick, sweet with the orange flavor coming through the entire bite. The orange peel offers good flavor, with a sour finish.\n\nI also tried the Egg Drop Soup with fresh Corn. This soup brought the corn flavor immediately and it lasted throughout the entire bite. It gave a freshness and texture to the soup. The soup was very flavorful, salty, with the egg cooked perfectly to offer a creamy texture.\n\nMy wife had the Braised Pork Shank with steam bun. This dish was made with braised pork shank, different spices and homemade buns. The pork was very tender, the spice was not hot, and the allspice comes through above all else. However, we both thought that the pork was under seasoned. The skin was fatty and gelatinous but worked when combined with the tender pork under it. The sauce was sweet and coated the pork well. The bao bun was sticky, spongy, soft and had a little sweetness to it. It chews well with the pork.\n\nLin's offers beer, wine and a full bar. The menu changes by the season. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The Fat Man says that Lin Asian Bar and Dim Sum is Fat Man Approved with 2 chins.",

The place is lively and we got seated at the bar (would have preferred a table for how many dishes we ended up trying).\nThe bartender was great at helping us through recommendations because it was our first time and I am a vegetarian. She recommended us to pick our cocktails and then gave us food recs that paired well with the cocktails. I loved the Thai Basil Gimlet, such a good easy sipping drink and my partner got the Austin XLing which was a boozy sweet drink.  We ordered the cucumbers (which were refreshing but kinda plain- probably wouldn’t get again). But the pan fried veggie dumplings were so good, we were fighting over them. People said the chicken dumplings paired super well with the cocktails. Don’t forget to ask for chili oil and vinegar with your dumplings. The soy sauce that it comes with is good but the chili oil takes it to the next level.  We ordered the fried rice as our main to round out the meal and it was simple but really good. We would definitely come back, but would get a table next time!",

It was thinly sliced and marinated beef brisket with onion, and it was amazing! I really enjoyed the umami aspect of it and will definitely have to order a beef box next time.\n\nOverall, this is a great place to go to if you want cheap, yummy food and to support a small business!

Would definitely recommend.\n\nWe finished off with the donuts, and they transported me to my childhood of eating Chinese buffet food just to get the sugary goodness of donut balls.

The soup dumplings are especially amazing, and we've found everything we've tried to be of high quality and delicious.

He even had a drink named after him because he had returned from heart surgery recently. It is really lovely to see that a restaurant like this cares so much about their staff that they’d extend a gesture like this.\n\nThe food was unbelievable. We ordered the soup dumplings, green beans, honey pecan prawns, Peking duck, gong bao chicken, beef dish, fried rice, and more - every single item on the menu was to die for. I could have eaten any item we ordered as my meal every day for the rest of my life and been happy, it was that good.\n\n10/10 highly recommend this restaurant.",

If you pay $12 for a hamburger and fries, then why not eat healthier for the same price. ;P\n\nNo, I didn’t get paid to post this, neither received coupons or discounts.

We got seated quickly before the crowd.\n\nThere are arcade games for the youngsters in the lobby while waiting for a table.\n\nParking is a little challenging. There are only a few spots on the street. There is a parking garage that has two hour limit for free and then you have to start paying.\n\nFood was great we order Mapo tofu and braised pork belly with tea mushroom.

I could taste that reheated microwave taste/smell and I hate when restaurants do this. Second, the cumin lamb flavor was great but it was so sad that they deep fried the lamb first.\n\nNow, onto the great things. You can never fail with 3 dishes: soup dumplings, dry fried green beans, and deep fried Sichuan chicken. These are my go-to dishes and they never fail me!! So if you’re new to Wu Chow, do these 3.",

However, the menu proved to be extensive, offering choices from Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai cuisines. Despite being labeled as a typical Vietnamese restaurant, the focus seemed to be on a broader range of Asian cuisines. While the fried pork spring rolls were enjoyable, the use of a soup plate for serving seemed unorthodox and raised hygiene concerns, as depicted in picture 4. Despite this, the taste was commendable, although the portion size of 6 rolls felt excessive; reducing it to 4 might be more appropriate. The seafood pho stood out as a definite highlight and a dish I would revisit this Vietnamese eatery for. The hot soup base of the pho was exceptionally flavorful, almost tempting me to finish the entire bowl. The ambiance was simple, although I found the floor to be overly slippery, warranting caution for future visitors.",

It's an intimate setting, where we were seated close to two other parties, the ambiance was vibrant and not too loud. Our server and staff were great. They worked well together.\n\nThe menu offered a variety of options. We particularly enjoyed the lettuce wraps and the scallop caviar sui mai, which were both standout dishes. The salmon and yellowtail salad was refreshing, though it would have been better if the fish had been diced to complement each bite of the mango salad more effectively. The lobster cheese balls were yummy and if you use the mix from the lettuce wrap, adds even more flavor.\n\nWe tried the alligator entrée, which tasted like fried chicken karaage. I ordered a tart and foamy drink.\n\nAfter your meal,  take a leisurely stroll around the area. There's a park around the corner and there was a band performing music, it was nice to enjoy with the cooler wind.",

The salmon and yellowtail salad was refreshing, though it would have been better if the fish had been diced to complement each bite of the mango salad more effectively. The lobster cheese balls were yummy and if you use the mix from the lettuce wrap, adds even more flavor.\n\nWe tried the alligator entrée, which tasted like fried chicken karaage. I ordered a tart and foamy drink.\n\nAfter your meal,  take a leisurely stroll around the area. There's a park around the corner and there was a band performing music, it was nice to enjoy with the cooler wind.",
